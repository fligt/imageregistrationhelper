The capability to register or overlay of different technical images is
important in cultural heritage science. Although such overlays can be
created with various programs such as photo editors, the coordinates of
corresponding landmarks and transformation matrices is typically lost.

This python package is developed to perform interactive four point image
registration within Jupyter notebooks. In this way registration can be
made part of a larger computational workflow.
