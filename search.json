Although such overlays can be created with various programs such as photo editors, the coordinates of corresponding landmarks and transformation matrices is typically lost.\nThis python package is developed to perform interactive four point image registration (a.k.a. homography) within Jupyter notebooks. In this way image registration can be made part of a larger computational workflow.",
